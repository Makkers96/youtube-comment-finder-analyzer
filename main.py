    Comment: Don't agree with all of your points. I think SBI made faction warfare non-lethal to encourage new players to partake more rather then make whales swipe more. Not saying it shouldn't be IP capped tho. Absolutely agree in regards to the  .4 resources been added to the game. There was literally no reason to add that to the game other then the whales.

    Comment: Big Mcgee I totally agree with you bro, this update is dog sh*t, before the update I was actually actually able to compete against higher IP classes and outplay other players in solo content, pretty much If the other player has an awaked weapon Iâ€™m probably gonna die even if they make many mistakesâ€¦
